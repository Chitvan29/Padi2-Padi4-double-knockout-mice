Delayed puberty, gonadotropin abnormalities and subfertility in male Padi2/ Padi4 double knockout mice
Background: Peptidylarginine deiminase enzymes (PADs) convert arginine residues to citrulline in a process called
citrullination or deimination. Recently, two PADs, PAD2 and PAD4, have been linked to hormone signaling in vitro and
the goal of this study was to test for links between PAD2/PAD4 and hormone signaling in vivo.
Methods: Preliminary analysis of Padi2 and Padi4 single knockout (SKO) mice did not find any overt reproductive
defects and we predicted that this was likely due to genetic compensation. To test this hypothesis, we created a
Padi2/Padi4 double knockout (DKO) mouse model and tested these mice along with wild-type FVB/NJ (WT) and both
strains of SKO mice for a range of reproductive defects.
Results: Controlled breeding trials found that male DKO mice appeared to take longer to have their first litter than
WT controls. This tendency was maintained when these mice were mated to either DKO or WT females. Additionally,
unsexed 2-day old DKO pups and male DKO weanlings both weighed significantly less than their WT counterparts,
took significantly longer than WT males to reach puberty, and had consistently lower serum testosterone levels. Furthermore,
90-day old adult DKO males had smaller testes than WT males with increased rates of germ cell apoptosis.
Conclusions: The Padi2/Padi4 DKO mouse model provides a new tool for investigating PAD function and outcomes
from our studies provide the first in vivo evidence linking PADs with hormone signaling.
